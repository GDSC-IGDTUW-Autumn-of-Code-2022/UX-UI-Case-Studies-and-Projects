Hi. Checkout the drive link for my virtual pet adoption portal:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tcvELh-tgk8T6qad6EOsHDc51oIJ9abo/view?usp=share_link

Every image, every card and every design has been designed using figma, nothing has been downloaded or copied straight from the internet
Especially the cards under breed category have been designed by me from scratch

I have attached the cards separately, for improving the resolution and visibility
Please do check them out as well
