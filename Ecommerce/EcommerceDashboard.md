What is an Ecommerce Dashboard?

In a world where companies use numerous different tools to track business performance, data dashboards have become essential for conveying the most important numbers to teams within your company and your clients quickly and with ease.

An ecommerce dashboard has just that purpose. It provides your ecommerce team with a clear overview of key financial and website KPIs at any time. In addition, it enables tracking and analysis of essential elements for your ecommerce businesses on a day-to-day basis.Â 

Keeping a close eye on your ecommerce dashboard allows you to monitor the performance of your online store in real-time and, more importantly, ensure that all your customer journey is well-documented along with shopping experience events.
